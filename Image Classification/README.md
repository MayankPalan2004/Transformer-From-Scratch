# Image Classification

This project mainly dealt with the principle of Binary Classification which means that a given image can be either true(1) or false(0) to a particular reference.
In our project we build a cat-dog Classifier in which our model would classify images based whther that are cat or dog.

## Approach
We mainly used Tensorflow framework to achieve our results. We divided the dataset into two part i.e. for training and for testing. Keras were also used in building this model. Numpy a pre-defined libraries in python helped us to tain and test our model.

The graphs given below depict the training accuracy and also the loss function calcuations made during each epoch(loop) along with it's accuracy.
