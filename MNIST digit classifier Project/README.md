# ABOUT THE PROJECT

 This is neural network implementation from scatch on the MNIST dataset for digit classification
 In this we trained a deep neural network with 2 hidden layers on the dataset 
 The accuracy achieved is 97.56 percent on the training set 
 It was trained for 30 minutes on google collab for 660 epochs
