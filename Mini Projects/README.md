# Mini Projects we worked on
- Image Classification
- Spam Detection using Logistic Regression 
- MNIST digit classifier

## Image Classification
- This project deals with Binary Classification of Objects and would produce result 1(True) or 0(False).
- In our project we had to classify between cat and non-cat images.
- We used tensorflow and keras predefined libraries to achieve our goal.

##  Spam Detection using Logistic Regression 
- The idea of this post is to understand step by step working of the spam filter model. Also, next time when you see a “You have won a lottery” SMS rather than 
  ignoring it, you might prefer to report it as a spam.
- Here the logistic regression model is implemented from scratch, including functions for initialization, propagation, optimization, and prediction.

## MNIST digit Classifier
- MNIST digit classification is a fundamental problem in machine learning and computer vision. The trained neural network can accurately identify digits (0 to 9) 
  from images of handwritten characters.
- The MNIST dataset is loaded using Keras, ReLU activation functions are used for hidden layers, and softmax activation is used for the output layer.
